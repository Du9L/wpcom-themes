"As a passionate illustrator, I pursued a career in greeting cards and "
"advertisements. By 1903, I was known for my original poster work and also "
"excelled as a postcard artist, table designer, cartoonist, and children's "
"book author."

"In 1903, I began a seven-year collaboration with Queen City Publishing, "
"creating full-page layouts like the renowned Ink Beasts Parade, feakigenring "
"the orange-yellow Ibexiakigencus and Magenta Ponies. I designed a series of "
"doll-like figures and advertisements that were striking and ahead of their "
"time, with an art deco feel. My style resembled playing card figures, which "
"I used in a series of American Revolution stories published in The Sunday "
"Herald around 1904."

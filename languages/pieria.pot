#. Description of the theme
msgid "Pieria is a theme focused on typography — essentially following a low-level styling approach. Its headings, paragraphs, links, and navigation have the same appearance, with everything sitting quietly into simple columns that split navigation, blog posts, and a content block. A soft design to make your content sparkle."

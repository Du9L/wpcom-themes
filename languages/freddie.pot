"Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 â€“ 24 November 1991) "
"was a British singer and songwriter, who achieved worldwide fame as the lead "
"vocalist of the rock band Queen. Regarded as one of the greatest singers in "
"the history of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and "
"four-octave vocal range. Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman "
"with his theatrical style, influencing the artistic direction of Queen."

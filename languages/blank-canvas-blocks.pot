"Blank Canvas is a minimalist theme, designed for single-page websites. Its "
"single post and page layouts have no header, navigation menus, or widgets by "
"default, so the page you design in the WordPress editor is the same page "
"you’ll see on the front end. The theme’s default styles are conservative, "
"relying on simple sans-serif fonts and a subtle blue highlight color. Blank "
"Canvas is ready for your customizations."

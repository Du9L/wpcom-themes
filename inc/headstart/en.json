Placerville\u2014still Hangtown\u2014though already past the feverish days of its first youth, was some twenty-five miles to the southwest. A few miles to the south the emigrant trail from Carson crawled over the shoulder of the Sierra.

The forty-niners had passed it by in their eager rush for fortune. Yet the narrow gulch, that steamed at midday with heated airs and was steeped in the pungent fragrance which California exhales beneath the ardors of the sun, was yielding the two miners a good supply of gold. Their pits had honeycombed the stream\u2019s banks far up and down. Now, in September, the water had dwindled to a silver thread, and they had dammed it near the rocker into a miniature lake, into which Fletcher\u2014Moreau\u2019s partner\u2014plunged his dipper with untiring regularity, at the same time moving the rocker which filled the hot silence of the ca\u00f1on with its lazy monotonous rattle.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They had been working with little cessation since early June.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph --><cite>Citation<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n<!-- \/wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The richness of their claim and the prospect that the first snows would put an end to labors and profits had spurred them to unremitting exertion. In a box under Moreau\u2019s bunk there were six small buckskin sacks of dust, joint profits of the summer\u2019s toil.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreau, a muscular, fair-haired giant of a man, was that familiar figure of the early days\u2014the gentleman miner. He was a New Englander of birth and education, who had come to California in the first rush, with a little fortune wherewith to make a great one. Luck had not been with him. This was his first taste of success. Five months before he had picked up a \u201cpard\u201d in Sacramento, and after the careless fashion of the time, when no one sought to inquire too closely into another\u2019s antecedents, joined forces with him and spent a wandering spring, prospecting from bar to bar and camp to camp. The casual words of an Indian had directed them to the ca\u00f1on where now the creak of their rocker filled the hot, drowsy days.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",
